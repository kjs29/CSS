# Basic structure of HTMl

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>
```
`<html>` represents the root of an HTML document. All other html elements must be descendants of this element.

`<head>` has important information such as title.

`<body>` has what shows up on the browser such as texts, images.

# 3 Components of HTML

## Tags

A text that is inside `<>` and `</>`. The text is used to tell browser how to display.

Tags usually come in pairs, an opening tag and a closing tag.

Some tag doesn't have a closing tag such as `<img src="asset/img/balloon.png" alt="Balloon picture">`.

## Elements

- If the tag has a pair of an opening tag and a closing tag,

An element refers to both opening and closing tag, and all the content between the tags.

- If the tag doesn't have a closing tag,

An element refers to the tag itself.

## Attributes

An attribute is used to describe the additional information about an element. It goes inside the opening tag, and it usually has name/value pair such as `name="password"` (`name` is name, `password` is value).

## Common attributes

- `id` gives unique identifier

- `class` assigns an element to a class

- `title` shows a cool hover feature when user hover their mouse on the text

- `target` directs the link to 

`id` and `class` are case sensitive.

If we want to use two classes or more in one element, we can use space.

```html
<p class="fancy-paragraph error-message">Oh no! You have entered a wrong address!</p> <!-- Two classes are used -->
```

# Question

What is a recommended way to use linebreak : `<br>` tag?

1. Use a `br` element between every paragraph.

2. Use a separate `p` element for each paragraph.

3. It doesn't matter. Both methods are equally valid.
