The other day we covered the html part to create a website [here](https://github.com/kjs29/HTML-CSS/blob/master/today%20I%20learned/06.05%20what%20to%20think%20about%20when%20creating%20a%20website.md).

To create a website that looks like the picture below,

![image](https://github.com/kjs29/HTML-CSS/assets/96529477/f852836d-cb71-4184-b0c4-5c670e88382a)

We need

1. wrapper (This is the html part)

2. styling (This is the css part)

# Today, we will cover the second part, styling.

## The first thing to do is to change the font-size so that I can see the whole file easily.

And we can do so like in the following code below.

```css
html {
    font-size: 62.5%;
}
```

## The second thing to do is to think of what body element does.

What body element does are these...

- determines the website's background color

- has default margin

- determines the predominant font for the website

  - When using google font, use html code instead of css code.

```html

<html>
<!-- code snip --> 
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Playfair+Display&family=Poppins:wght@200;400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
<!-- code snip -->
</html>
```

```css
body {
    margin: 0;
    font-family: 'Poppins';
}
```

## the next thing to do is `<div>` tag with `wrapper` class.

The `<div>` tag with `wrapper` class wraps around all the elements in the body tag.

We need to set the max-width and margin.

```css
.wrapper {
    max-width: 1200px;
    margin: 0 auto;
}
```

## the next thing to do is `<header>` tag.

The header tag represents navigation menu on the top.

<img width="700" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-07 at 9 15 27 AM" src="https://github.com/kjs29/HTML-CSS/assets/96529477/77e421e8-3f26-4964-b48a-25e3664a2934">

The red box is where the head tag represents.

However, the logo and menu are stacked on top of each other,

we want to make them sit next to each other.

We can do this by having a display to `flex`.

```css
header {
    display: flex;
}
```

The website now looks like this.

<img width="700" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-07 at 9 25 06 AM" src="https://github.com/kjs29/HTML-CSS/assets/96529477/399e15f7-7370-40c2-8212-7d7b621f63d4">

They are sitting next to each other.

The default flex direction is horizontal (From left to right direction).

Now we want the menu to sit on the right edge of the website, not next to logo.

We can achieve this by `justify-content: space-between`.

```css
header {

    /* Put the elements horizontally */
    display: flex;

    /* Put the elements with some spaces in between of each other */
    justify-content: space-between;
}
```

Also, we want the space on top of the logo, 

we can use margin or padding, but we will have `align-items` centered.

Here is the code for these.

```css
header {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;

    /* vertically adjust to the center */
    align-items: center;
}
```

Now it looks like this.
