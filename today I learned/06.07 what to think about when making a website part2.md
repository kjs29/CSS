The other day we covered the html part to create a website.

The first step to make a website that looks like the picture below is

1. wrapper (This is the html part)

2. styling (This is the css part)

Today, we will cover the second part, styling.

# The first thing to do is to change the font-size so that I can see the whole file easily.

And we can do so like in the following code below.

```css
html {
    font-size: 62.5%;
}
```

# The second thing to do is to think of what body element does.

What body element does are these...

- determines the website's background color

- has default margin

- determines the predominant font for the website

  - When using google font, use html code instead of css code.

```css
body {
    margin: 0;
    font-family: 'Poppins';
}
```
