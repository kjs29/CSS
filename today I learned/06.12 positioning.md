# Positioning

Position in CSS determines where elements should locate.

When elements are not set to any position, they are static position by default.

We can't move it around when it is static position.

When it is relative


When an element is absolute, it finds its nearest relative positioned element, and play with that element. 

Btw, body tag is relative of position.

Let's look at the following example.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <style>
        body {
            margin: 0;
        }

        div.parent {
            position: relative;
            background-color: aqua;
            width: 400px;
            height: 400px;
        }
        
        div.child {
            position: absolute;
            background-color: bisque;
            width: 100px;
            height: 100px;
            bottom: -50px;
            left: 50%;
            transform: translateX(-50%);
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="parent">
        box1
        <div class="child">box2</div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

A parent should be relative of position for an absolute positoned element to move around based on the parent element.

In this case, box2 is a child element, and it is absolute positioned.

Since its direct parent element's (box1) position is relative, the box2 moves based on box1.

If there is no relative positioned parents, the absolute element moves based on the body tag, since body tag is relative of position.
