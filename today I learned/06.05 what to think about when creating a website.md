# Let's say we want to create a website that looks like this.

# The very first thing to think about is

Wrapper(Skeletons)

or, how to create an HTML file.

---

Why?

Because we need to structure the elements in the way we want to display on a browser, 

and the wrapper will help us to do it.

Here's how to think of it.

### 1. The whole website is located in the middle of the browser, vertically and horizontally.

In the screenshot below, the red squared box is a wrapper.

Let's take a look at the following html code,

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="wrapper">
        
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

### 2. The navigation menu wrapper

We see that the logo is on the left hand side, and the menu is on the right hand side.

That means that we need to create each wrapper for logo, and menu.

And then we need to put them together in the same parent wrapper.

Let's take a look at this example html code.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="wrapper">
        
        <!-- wrapper tag for the whole top header part -->
        <header>
            
            <!-- first item -->
            <a href="#"><img src="./resources/img/logo.svg" alt="Fauxica Logo"></a>
            
            <!-- second item -->
            <nav>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#" class="active">Home</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">Products</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">Gallery</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
                </ul>
            </nav>

        </header>

    </div>
</body>
</html>

```

There is a class "active" assigned to the first <li> tag. That is to indicate that which page the <li> is on currently.

### 3. body wrapper
    
    
Let's take a look at the following picture.
    
![image](https://github.com/kjs29/HTML-CSS/assets/96529477/f51a9bf0-1538-43b5-bd35-43b5a632bfd0)

In this red box, there are two columns, one on the left, and one on the right.

If we implement this observation into our code,
    
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="wrapper">

    <!-- code snip -->

        <main>
            <div class="left-col">
                
            </div>
            
            <div class="right-col">

            </div>
        </main>

    </div>
</body>
</html>
```
    
Notice that `<main>` tag and two divs with left-col class, and right-col class.

There are also two more sections below these two col elements.

But I will stop explaining about the wrapper, because the principle applies the same.
    
The first step is to think that every element is in boxes and we need to be able to categorize them.

Now we can go to the next step, [CSS part]().
