The very first thing to think about is

Wrapper 

Let's take a look at the following html code,

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="wrapper">
        
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

The wrapper usually is in the middle of the browser, vertically and horizontally.

In the screenshot below, the red squared box is a wrapper.

The next wrapper to think about is the navigation menu wrapper



```html

```
