# Selectors

Selectors allow us to select the appropriate html tags in a css file.

# Regular selectors

```css
#blue {
    color: blue;
}

.italicized {
    font-style: italic;
}

p {
    color: teal;
}
```

`#blue`, `.italicized`, `p` are selectors.

When they have # in front, they select a tag with blue id. `<id="blue">`

```html
<div id="blue">randomdiv</div>
```

When they have . in front, they select all the tags with italicized class. `<class="italicized">` 

```html
<div class="italicized">pasta</div>
<p class="italicized">hello</p>
```

When they have just p, or div, they point to just regular tags.

```html
<p>Hello my name is Jinsung</p>
```


# Chain Selectors

```css
div.blue {
    color: blue;
}
```

This means that all the divs with class="blue" will be selected and changed its color to blue.

```html
<div class="blue">I am changed to blue</div>

<p class="blue">I am not changed to blue</p>
```

# Descendant Combinator

```css
div p {
    color: red;
}
```

This selector `div p` selects all the `<p></p>` tags inside `<div></div>`. `<p></p>` doesn't have to be direct children.

```html
<div>
    <aside>
        <p>hello</p> <!-- this will change to red -->
        <p>world</p> <!-- this will change to red -->
    </aside>
    <p>I am red too</p>
</div>
```
